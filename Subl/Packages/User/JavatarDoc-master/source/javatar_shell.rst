|J| Shell
=========

|J| shell works like a normal shell terminal.
The difference between |J| shell and others shells is that |J| shell will accept your input by pressing the Enter/Return keys. This gives you the ability to read in your content on the current line.

While |J| shell is running, you can close the view to force quit any application that is still running in the shell.

.. warning:: |J| cannot guarantee that output or input will be correct when you type in the |J| shell while it is still printing an output since |J| shell did not set the view to read-only while printing.
