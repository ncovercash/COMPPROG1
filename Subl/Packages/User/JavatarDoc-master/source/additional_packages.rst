Additional Packages
===================

By default, |J| is not include any additional packages inside its package.
This helps |J| faster to install/update from Package Control but that not provides any support for some features (for example, Organize Imports).
To solve this problem, |J| will automatically download and install necessary packages when startup.

For other packages, you can download and install using *Packages Manager... > Install Packages...* menu.

If you want to suggest or add Javatar Packages to the package repository. Please leave an issue in `Javatar Packages repository`_.
